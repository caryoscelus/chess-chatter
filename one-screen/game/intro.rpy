    anon "You'll have only one game, so please choose carefully!"
    anon "And you, bettors, will have last chance to reconsider your bets after lots are taken!"
    "After that short loud speech of announcer, there's a silence of expectation in the air."
    "Two figures climb on podium and after short hesitation take their lots."

    "This man, apparently called David, has just arrived here in our town a few days ago."
    "His shabby look and thin figure suggest he's one of those who have lost everything and trying their luck to get something to live on."
    "Most of such fellows loose."
    "And some extremely unlucky who fall into temptation to play with The Red King, loose everything."
    "Everybody think they will be the first to win against him and get all the riches he offering."
    "But in the end, no one ever won in public game with King."
    "And after each winning he killed the looser and added his skull to his private collection."
    "Something is definitely wrong with that man (and those who agree to play with him, knowing his story)."
    "But luckily, today he is only watching. Probably there won't be any blood after games."

    "The second player is a rare type here: she's the only woman that i saw playing in such a place entire month."
    "She must be really desperate to come here."
    "Even though on first glance, she doesn't seem to be that poor."
    "But first impression is usually lying."
    "Judging by her face, she isn't type to play out of pure interest."
    "She probably lost everything, but doesn't won't to give up her hope."
    "Maybe doing this for her children or dying parents who needs doctor and can't afford one.."
    "But then it's pretty stupid."
    "If she has no experience, chances to win are low unless she's lucky to get same level opponent."

    "They both look at their lots and like it happens all the time at such moments, suddenly gain the opposite expressions on their faces."
    "Winning smile appears on David's face, while Susie makes a sad sigh and her desperate look becomes even more so."
    "They slowly walk to the playing table as the announcer starts to speak again and public starts to whisper."
    "Some even talk aloud, not concerned with strict official rules no one actually tries to enforce."
    "Some change their bets or make them just now."
    "Like betting on white or black matters."
    "If you bet on white, you'll get less gain proportional to average winning rate anyway."
    "That rule may or may not apply to players."
    "It won't this time, since David is betting his freedom on the game."
    "So he can either became slave or not. No middle options."
    "As for Susie, her stake is more countable, but all the same, she probably bets all her savings."
    "And that's pretty fair trade."
