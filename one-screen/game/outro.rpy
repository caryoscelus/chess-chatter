    anon "32 turn game by two amateurs with nearly their lifes at stake, is now over in a funny ending where pure material weight doesn't matter anymore!"
    "His voice is somewhat formally happy like always when he can see the public was entertained and club gained a lot from bets."
    "It's his job to be happy at such moments, so all the sincerity has vanished long time ago."

    "On the other hand, David seems to be genuinely happy at first."
    "By hobo standards, he is rich now."
    "But then his face becomes tired and somewhat irritated as he tries to push throw the crowd and all the dealers offering him management"
    "(Which is basically robbing off player with nearly no gurantees; some say this tradition has been successfully caried from the ancient times, but who would believe that?)."
    dav "I just want some ramen and a bed to sleep on"
    "He says that to no one in particular."
    "But that immediately leads to a bunch of merchants importunately offering him their services."
    "I notice sheriff's secret agent (or rather errand boy) carefully watching if someone will rob the winner."
    "He doesn't do that out of love for justice, but just for profit: if the criminal is found, he will be sold into slavery."
    "And half of the price will go directly to sheriff. The other half will go to him inderectly."
    "Surely he'll share a little bit of it with this kid."
    "But David seems to be cautious: even if he's new to our town, he's certainly not new to this kind of clubs."

    "I switch my gaze to the crowd, searching for Susie."
    "She stands near the bar, apparently waiting for barman to fulfil her order."
    "He doesn't try to be fast. She bears no interest for her in current state of looser."
    "He's not the type who now awaits her probable \"moral fall\", neither for his own pleasure, nor for profit."
    "When he finally gives her some drink in a dirty glass, she greedily swallows it in a few gulps."
    "By her reaction, i can see she never drank something stronger than ale."
    "But Susie doesn't seem to care about how she looks now."
    "She puts her head on counter and sobs silently."
    "It's not that crowded at this hour, so barman doesn't care about it."
